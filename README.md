## Introduction
Ecommerce related data such as items and their respective price, stock, name, category, and tag are stored in the backend using sequelize- an object relational mapper (ORM) for mysql2. Routing/Business logic is handled with express and the user can acquire and manipulate stored information through a series of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes through Insomnia, etc, or through the browser (GET).
